AutoDM Monitors

Set up persistent monitors that automatically send private DMs to users who comment on your Instagram posts. Monitors run in the background 24/7 — no need to keep polling manually.

Start a Monitor

Create a new AutoDM monitor for an Instagram post. The monitor will check for new comments at regular intervals and send a private reply (DM) to each new commenter.

Important Notes

Instagram only. AutoDM monitors currently support Instagram only, using Meta's official Private Replies API.

One DM per comment. Each comment can only receive one private reply. Duplicate attempts are automatically prevented.

7-day comment window. Private replies can only be sent to comments less than 7 days old.

Daily DM limits. Upload-Post enforces daily DM limits per account (varies by plan). When the limit is reached, the monitor pauses and resumes the next day.

Auto-expiration. Monitors automatically stop after 15 days to prevent stale monitors from running indefinitely.

Rate limits. Meta enforces a limit of 200 DMs per hour per Instagram account. The monitor includes built-in delays between DMs to stay within limits.

How It Works

You start a monitor with a post URL and reply message.

Every monitoring\_interval minutes, the monitor checks for new comments.

For each new comment, it sends a private DM using Meta's Private Replies API.

It tracks which comments have already been replied to, avoiding duplicates.

After 15 days, the monitor automatically stops.

Related Endpoints

Instagram Comments — Read comments and send one-off private replies manually.

Instagram Direct Messages — Send follow-up DMs and read conversations.

Media List — Find post IDs and URLs for your Instagram content.

FFmpeg Editor API

Process and transform media using your own FFmpeg command safely on our infrastructure. Submit a job with your media and a command template, then poll the job until it finishes and download the result.

Endpoint

Headers

| Name          | Value                    | Description                      |
|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Authorization | Apikey your-api-key-here | Your API key for authentication. |

Parameters

| Name              | Type          | Required | Description |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| file              | File (binary) | Yes      | Media file to process. |
| full\_command      | String        | Yes      | FFmpeg command template that MUST use {input} and {output} placeholders. Example: ffmpeg -y -i {input} -c:v libx264 -crf 23 {output} |
| output\_extension  | String        | Yes      | Desired output file extension (e.g., mp4, wav, mp3, mov, webm). |

Note: If the duration of the input media cannot be detected, the system assumes 60 seconds for quota calculation.

Command Template Rules

For security and reliability, only safe FFmpeg commands are accepted.

Use placeholders: {input} (or indexed {input0}, {input1}, …) for input files and {output} for the output file; do not hardcode filenames. The first input can be referenced as {input} or {input0}.

Allowed pattern starts with ffmpeg and may include typical flags (e.g., -y, -i, -c:v, -c:a, -r, -b:v, filters, etc.).

Blocked characters/constructs to prevent command injection: ;, |, &, $, \\\`\`, $(, and destructive commands like rm/rmdir\`.

Newlines and carriage returns in the command string are automatically replaced with spaces (not blocked), so pasting multi-line commands works. To render multi-line text in the drawtext filter, use the literal escape \n (backslash + n) — in JSON, send \\\n.

If validation fails, the API returns 400 Bad Request with a helpful message.

Responses

202 Accepted (job created)

Check Job Status

Poll the job until it finishes.

Example response:

Statuses: PENDING, PROCESSING, FINISHED, ERROR.

Download Result

When status is FINISHED, download the processed file.

Response headers include the appropriate Content-Type and a Content-Disposition attachment filename (e.g., output.mp4, output.wav). The response body is the binary media.

Example: Convert to MP4 (H.264)

Example: Extract Audio to WAV

Concatenate/Merge multiple videos (NEW)

The API now supports multiple input files for operations like concatenation. You can use placeholders {input0}, {input1}, {input2}, etc., in full\_command.

Option A: Send multiple URLs (JSON endpoint)

Option B: Upload multiple files (multipart/form-data)

Concatenation examples

Simple concatenation (2 videos):

Concatenation with re-encoding (multiple videos):

Using the concat demuxer (no re-encoding — faster but requires identical formats):

First create a text file with the list of videos, upload it as file and the videos as file1, file2, etc.:

Important: The {input} placeholder still works as before (points to the first file). For multiple inputs, use {input0}, {input1}, {input2}, etc.

Limitation: The predefined presets (h264\_social, hevc\_social, copy\_mux) and ffmpeg\_args only support a single file. For multiple inputs, you must use full\_command.

Example: Draw Multi-Line Text on Video

Use the drawtext filter with \n for line breaks. In JSON, escape as \\\n:

JSON body example:

Quotas by Plan (minutes of media/month)

| Plan          | Minutes/Month |
|---------------|----------------|
| free          | 30             |
| basic         | 300            |
| professional  | 1000           |
| advanced      | 3000           |
| business      | 10000          |

Resets on the 1st of each month at 00:00 UTC.

Check Your FFmpeg Consumption

To check your current FFmpeg usage and remaining quota, use:

Example response:

You can also view your FFmpeg usage in the API Keys page or your Profile page.

Errors

400 Bad Request: Invalid or unsafe FFmpeg command, missing parameters.

401 Unauthorized: Invalid or expired API key.

404 Not Found: Job not found.

429 Too Many Requests: Monthly quota exceeded (response includes current usage when applicable).

500 Internal Server Error: Processing error.

Notes

Jobs are asynchronous; always poll the job status before attempting to download the output.

Quota checks use detected media duration to ensure fair usage across plans.

X (Twitter)

youtube

threads

pinterest

reddit

bluesky

Support for additional platforms will be added in the future. If you request a platform that is not yet supported, the response will include a message indicating this for that specific platform.

Here is an example of how to call the endpoint to get analytics for the test profile on Instagram, YouTube, Threads, Pinterest, and Reddit.

Example Successful Response (200 OK):

The response is a JSON object where each key corresponds to a requested platform. The value is another object containing the specific analytics data for that platform.

Field Descriptions for Platform Analytics:

followers: Total number of followers.

reach: The number of unique accounts that have seen any of the profile's content.

views: Total content views (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok). For Instagram, this is the official "views" metric from the Instagram API, which replaced the deprecated "impressions" metric.

impressions: Alias for views on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. On other platforms (X, Pinterest, Threads), this represents content impressions. Kept for backwards compatibility.

profileViews: Total number of times the profile was viewed. For Instagram, this represents "Accounts Engaged" (unique accounts that interacted with the content).

likes: Total number of likes across the profile's content.

comments: Total number of comments across the profile's content.

shares: Total number of shares across the profile's content.

saves: Total number of saves across the profile's content.

pin\_clicks: Total number of clicks on pins (Pinterest only).

outbound\_clicks: Total number of clicks to external URLs from pins (Pinterest only).

reach\_timeseries: An array of objects showing the daily reach or views value over the last 30 days. The dashboard filters this data client-side based on the selected date range.

metric\_type: Indicates what the reach\_timeseries represents for this platform. Values: "reach" (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), "views" (YouTube, TikTok, Threads), "impressions" (X, Pinterest), "score" (Reddit). Use this to avoid double-counting when aggregating across platforms.

primary\_impressions\_field: The field name used as the primary metric for aggregation on this platform (e.g., "reach" for Instagram, "impressions" for YouTube).

available\_metrics: Array of available metric keys for this platform.

metric\_labels: Object mapping metric keys to user-friendly labels for this platform.

For a unified total impressions metric across platforms, see the Total Impressions section below.

Error Responses:

400 Bad Request: The platforms query parameter is missing or invalid.

401 Unauthorized: The JWT is missing, invalid, or expired.

404 Not Found: The specified profile\_username does not exist for the authenticated user.

500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server while fetching the data.

title: 'Total Impressions API'

GET /api/uploadposts/total-impressions/profile\_username

Returns a unified "total impressions" metric for a profile, aggregated from daily analytics snapshots across all connected platforms.

Method: GET

Endpoint URL: https://api.upload-post.com/api/uploadposts/total-impressions/profile\_username

Description:

This endpoint provides a single, deduplicated "total impressions" metric that intelligently combines reach and views data across platforms. Since different platforms report different types of impression metrics (Facebook and Instagram report "reach", YouTube and TikTok report "views"), this endpoint uses the most representative metric for each platform to avoid double-counting.

You can also request custom metrics aggregation by specifying which metrics to aggregate using the metrics parameter.

GET /api/uploadposts/post-analytics?platform\_post\_id=

Returns analytics for any post (including organically published posts) using its native platform ID instead of a request ID.

Method: GET

Endpoint URL: https://api.upload-post.com/api/uploadposts/post-analytics?platform\_post\_id=XXXXX\&platform=instagram\&user=profile\_username

Description:

This endpoint allows you to fetch live per-post analytics using the platform's native post ID (e.g., an Instagram media ID) rather than an Upload Post request\_id. This is useful for retrieving metrics on organically published posts that were not uploaded through the API. You can obtain platform\_post\_id values from the GET /api/uploadposts/media endpoint.

Authentication:

A valid JSON Web Token (JWT) is required. Include it in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Apikey \<YOUR\_JWT\_TOKEN>

Parameters:

| Parameter          | Type   | Location | Required | Description                              |

--- START OF docs/api/get-google-business-locations.md ---

This endpoint queries the Google Business Profile API in real-time to return all available locations for a connected account. Use this to let users choose which location to post to.

Get Google Business Locations

Method: GET

Endpoint: /api/uploadposts/google-business/locations

Authentication:

API Key in the Authorization header.

Authorization: Apikey \<YOUR\_API\_KEY>

Query Parameters:

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                             | Required |
| :-------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--- |
| profile | string | Optional. The profile's username. If provided, the API will return only the locations associated with the Google Business account linked to that profile. | No   |

Successful Response (200 OK)

| Field      | Description                                                    |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name     | The Google Business location identifier (used as gbp\_location\_id in uploads) |
| title    | Display name of the business location                          |
| account\_id | The internal Upload-Post account key                        |

Using Locations in Upload Requests

The gbp\_location\_id parameter tells the API which location to post to. First list the available locations using the endpoint above, then include the selected location's name as gbp\_location\_id in your upload request.

| Parameter        | Type   | Description                                              | Required |
| :--------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| gbp\_location\_id | string | The location to post to. Must be a valid location name from the locations list. | No\*  |

This parameter works with all upload endpoints (/api/upload, /api/upload\_photos, /api/upload\_text).

Auto-select fallback: If gbp\_location\_id is not provided, the API will automatically query your available locations. If your account has exactly one location, it will be used automatically. If you have multiple locations, the API returns an error asking you to select one. If you have zero locations, the API returns an error indicating no locations were found.

Example:

Additional Notes:

Locations are queried live from the Google Business API each time you call this endpoint.

The endpoint handles token refresh automatically if the stored access token has expired.

Connect your Google account via OAuth first — the connection stores your credentials, and this endpoint uses them to fetch locations in real-time.

Works the same way as Facebook pages: connect once, then select which location to post to on each upload.

Important Notes

7-day window for private replies: Some platforms only allow private replies to recent comments (e.g., Instagram requires comments less than 7 days old). Public replies do not have this restriction.

Comment must be on your post: You can only reply to comments on posts owned by the authenticated account.

Daily limits: Upload-Post enforces a configurable daily limit per user. Both private and public replies count toward this limit. When exceeded, the API returns a 429 status code.

Public vs. private replies: Use /comments/reply to send a private DM to the comment author. Use /comments/public-reply to post a visible reply under the original comment. Both require the comment\_id from the Get Post Comments endpoint.

Using comment data for DMs: Each comment includes the commenter's user ID. You can use this ID with the Direct Messages endpoint to send follow-up DMs directly.

Important Notes

Messaging policies vary by platform: Each platform has its own messaging rules. For example, Instagram requires the recipient to have messaged your account first (24-hour window).

Daily DM limits: Upload-Post enforces a configurable daily DM limit per user to prevent accidental overuse. When the limit is reached, the API returns a 429 status code.

Where to find the recipient ID

The recipient's User ID can be obtained from:

The Get Conversations endpoint above (each participant has an id field).

The Get Post Comments endpoint (GET /api/uploadposts/comments) where each comment includes the commenter's user.id.

Difference from Comment Replies

| Feature | Comment Reply (/comments/reply) | Direct Message (/dms/send) |
|---|---|---|
| Recipient | comment\_id — replies to a specific comment | recipient\_id — sends to a user by ID |
| Use case | Auto-reply to post engagement | Customer support, follow-up conversations |

Queue System

The queue system allows you to automatically schedule posts to predefined time slots. Instead of specifying an exact date/time with scheduled\_date, you can use add\_to\_queue=true to have the system automatically assign your post to the next available slot.

How It Works

The queue is always active with default time slots (9am, 12pm, 5pm Eastern Time). You can customize these slots, timezone, and active days through the Queue Settings endpoints.

When you upload content with add\_to\_queue=true:

The system finds the next available slot based on your queue configuration

Your post is automatically scheduled to that slot

You receive a job\_id to track the scheduled post

Multiple Posts Per Slot

By default, each slot accepts 1 post. You can increase this with the max\_posts\_per\_slot setting to allow multiple posts in the same time slot. This is useful when you want to post to different platforms at the same time (e.g., an Instagram post and a Facebook post both at 9am).

You can also mark individual slots as full to prevent new posts from being added, even if they haven't reached the maximum capacity.

Using the Queue in Uploads

Add the add\_to\_queue parameter to any upload endpoint:

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| add\_to\_queue | Boolean | No | If true, automatically schedules the post to your next available queue slot. Cannot be used together with scheduled\_date. |
| max\_posts\_per\_slot | Integer | No | Override the profile's max\_posts\_per\_slot setting for this request. Only used when add\_to\_queue=true. |

|---------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Authorization | Apikey your-api-key-here   | Your API key for authentication          |
| Idempotency-Key | unique-string | Optional. Prevents duplicate uploads if the same request is retried (e.g., after a timeout). Can also be sent as X-Idempotency-Key or X-Request-Id. When provided, if a matching upload job already exists, the API returns the existing job instead of creating a duplicate. |

Common Parameters

| Name       | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                   |

| platform\[] | Array  | Yes      | Platform(s) to upload to. Supported values: tiktok, instagram, linkedin, facebook, x, threads, pinterest, bluesky, reddit, google\_business |
| photos\[]   | Array  | Yes      | Array of files to upload. Accepts photos (jpg, png, etc.).  Note: You can also include videos (mp4, mov, etc.) ONLY for Instagram and Threads mixed carousels. |
| title      | String | Conditional | Default title/caption of the post. Required for Reddit. Optional for all other platforms (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, Threads, Bluesky, Pinterest). |
| description    | String | No       | Optional extended text used on TikTok photo descriptions, LinkedIn commentary, Facebook descriptions, Pinterest notes, and Reddit bodies. Ignored elsewhere. |
| request\_id | String | No | Client-provided request identifier. If omitted, the server generates one. Returned in every response and used to track the upload via Upload Status. Useful when async\_upload=true and the HTTP response might be lost (e.g., timeout). Can also be sent as an X-Request-Id header. |
| scheduled\_date | String (ISO-8601) | No | Optional date/time (ISO-8601) to schedule publishing, e.g., "2024-12-31T23:45:00Z". Must be in the future (≤ 365 days). Omit for immediate upload. |
| timezone | String (IANA) | No | Optional timezone identifier (e.g., "Europe/Madrid", "America/New\_York"). If provided, scheduled\_date is interpreted in this timezone. Defaults to UTC if omitted. See IANA Time Zone Database for valid values. |
| async\_upload  | Boolean | No      | If true, the request returns immediately with a request\_id and processes in the background. See Upload Status. |
| add\_to\_queue  | Boolean | No      | If true, automatically schedules the post to your next available queue slot. Cannot be used with scheduled\_date. See Queue System. |
| max\_posts\_per\_slot | Integer | No | Override the profile's max posts per slot setting for this request. Only used when add\_to\_queue=true. See Queue System. |
| first\_comment | String | No       | Automatically post a first comment after publishing. Supported on Instagram, Facebook, Threads, Bluesky, Reddit, X, YouTube, and LinkedIn. On X (Twitter) and Threads, this creates a reply to the main post. For X threads, the comment is posted as a reply to the last tweet in the thread. On YouTube, it posts as a top-level comment on the video. |
| first\_comment\_media\[] | File(s) | No | Image files to attach to the first comment as inline images. Currently supported on Reddit. Not available for scheduled or queued posts. |

Important: If you set async\_upload to false but the upload takes longer than 59 seconds, it will automatically switch to asynchronous processing to avoid timeouts. In that case, use the request\_id with the Upload Status endpoint to check the upload status and result.

Platform-Specific First Comments

The first\_comment parameter serves as a fallback. To set a custom first comment for a particular platform, use the optional \[platform]\_first\_comment parameter. If provided, it will override the main first\_comment for that platform.

Example Optional Parameters:

instagram\_first\_comment: "Follow for more content! #photography"

facebook\_first\_comment: "Let me know your thoughts in the comments!"

x\_first\_comment: "Thread incoming! 🧵"

threads\_first\_comment: "First comment on Threads!"

reddit\_first\_comment: "Source in the comments."

bluesky\_first\_comment: "More details in the replies."

linkedin\_first\_comment: "Source article in the comments."

Scheduling behavior: When you provide scheduled\_date, the API responds with 202 Accepted and includes a job\_id. That same job\_id will later appear in Upload History to correlate the scheduled job with the publish record. You can also use the job\_id with the Upload Status endpoint to check the execution status of the scheduled post.

Video Support (Mixed Carousels):

Instagram & Threads: You can upload videos in the photos\[] array to create mixed carousels (photos + videos).

All other platforms (Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, X, Pinterest): Do NOT upload videos to this endpoint. Use the Upload Video endpoint instead. Uploading videos here for these platforms will result in an error.

Platform-Specific Titles

The title parameter serves as a fallback. To set a custom title for a particular platform, use the optional \[platform]\_title parameter. If provided, it will override the main title for that platform.

Example Optional Parameters:

instagram\_title: "Check out my latest reel on Instagram! #reels"

facebook\_title: "Excited to share this new video with my Facebook friends and family."

tiktok\_title: "New TikTok video just dropped! 🔥"

linkedin\_title: "A professional insight on the latest industry trends, discussed in this video."

x\_title: "New video out now! 📢"

Note: The caption is applied only to the first photo uploaded. For correct posting on Facebook, ensure the Page is directly associated with your personal profile and not managed through a Business Portfolio.

Note: If facebook\_page\_id is not provided, we will automatically use the user's only connected Page (if exactly one exists). If multiple Pages are connected, the API returns a helpful error with an available\_pages list so you can choose one. Posting to personal Facebook profiles via API is not supported by Meta; only Pages can be posted to.

X (Twitter)

:::warning URLs are stripped from every X post
Upload-Post removes every URL that X would turn into a clickable link from
the caption, title, and first\_comment before sending the tweet — schemed
URLs (https://, http://, ftp://), www. hosts, shorteners (t.co,
bit.ly, …), bare hostnames with a path (example.com/foo), and IPs with a
path.

Obfuscated forms (example\[.]com, hxxp://, unicode dots) are not
stripped because X does not parse them as links — they display as plain text
and are billed at the normal $0.015 rate.

Why: X charges $0.200 per post containing a URL vs $0.015 without —
13× more. See the
Character Limits page
for details.

Note: For Twitter uploads, specify the platform as "x" in the platform\[] array.

More than 4 images: X supports a maximum of 4 images per tweet. If you provide more than 4 images, the API will automatically create a thread, distributing images across multiple tweets (up to 4 images each). Use x\_thread\_image\_layout to control exactly how images are distributed across tweets.

The global description field is ignored for X photo uploads.

How X (Twitter) Thread Creation Works (Advanced Logic)

Note: The following describes the default thread creation logic. To override this and post long text as a single post, set the x\_long\_text\_as\_post parameter to true.

The system is engineered to create well-formatted, natural-looking threads on X (formerly Twitter). Instead of simply splitting text at every line break, it intelligently groups paragraphs to create more readable tweets.

Here's the step-by-step logic:

Intelligent Paragraph Grouping (Primary Method):

The function first identifies distinct paragraphs (any text separated by a blank line).
It then combines as many of these paragraphs as possible into a single tweet, filling it up to the 280-character limit without exceeding it. The double newline (\n\n) between combined paragraphs is preserved for formatting.
This results in fewer, more substantial tweets that flow naturally, just as if a person had written them.

Handling Exceptionally Long Paragraphs:

If a single paragraph is, by itself, longer than the 280-character limit, a more granular splitting logic is automatically triggered for that paragraph only:

Split by Line Break: The system first attempts to break the paragraph down by its individual line breaks (\n).

Split by Word: If any of those single lines are still too long, it will split them by words as a final resort.

Media Attachment:

Images are distributed across tweets according to the x\_thread\_image\_layout parameter. If not specified and more than 4 images are provided, they are automatically distributed in groups of 4. Text parts and image chunks are interleaved across the thread tweets.

| auto\_add\_music        | Boolean | No       | Automatically add background music to photos                                                | false   |
| disable\_comment       | Boolean | No       | Disable comments on the post                                                                | false   |
| brand\_content\_toggle | Boolean| No       | Set to true for paid partnerships that promote third-party brands.        | false   |
| brand\_organic\_toggle | Boolean| No       | Set to true when promoting the creator's own business.                    | false   |
| photo\_cover\_index     | Integer | No       | Index (starting at 0) of the photo to use as the cover/thumbnail for the TikTok photo post  | 0       |
| tiktok\_description or description    | String  | No       | For photo posts, used as description inside post\_info (max 4,000 characters). | title   |

Note on Draft Mode (MEDIA\_UPLOAD): When using MEDIA\_UPLOAD mode (Draft), TikTok does not allow setting a title, caption, privacy settings, or other metadata via the API. The video is simply uploaded to your TikTok inbox/drafts, and you must add the title, caption, and settings manually within the TikTok app before publishing.

Instagram

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| instagram\_title | String | No       | Specific title for the Instagram post. Fallbacks to title. | title |
| media\_type | String | No | Type of media ("IMAGE" or "STORIES"). Automatically handles CAROUSEL/REELS logic if mixed media is detected. | "IMAGE" |
| collaborators | String | No | Comma-separated list of collaborator usernames. | - |
| user\_tags | String | No | Users to tag on the photo. Photo posts require x/y coordinates — see below. | - |
| location\_id | String | No | Instagram location ID. | - |

Note on Instagram user\_tags for photo posts

Instagram's Graph API requires x and y coordinates (floats between 0.0 and 1.0, marking the tag position on the image) whenever you tag a user on a photo post. Username-only tags are silently dropped by Instagram on photos — the post still publishes, but without the tag.

Send user\_tags as a JSON-encoded array of objects:

Tag multiple users by adding more objects, each with its own coordinates:

For carousels, the same tags are applied to every image in the carousel.

Reels/videos accept the simpler comma-separated form ("@user1, user2") because Instagram does not require coordinates for video tags. See Upload Video.

The global description field is ignored for Instagram uploads (title serves as caption).

Threads

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| threads\_title | String | No | Specific title for the Threads post. Fallbacks to title. | title |
| threads\_thread\_media\_layout | String | No | Comma-separated list of how many media items to include in each Threads post. Each value must be 0-10, and the total must equal the number of files. Use 0 for a text-only post in the thread (e.g., "0,5" makes the first post text-only and attaches all 5 media items to the second post). Example: "5,5" splits 10 items into 2 posts of 5 each; "3,4,3" splits 10 items into 3 posts. If omitted and more than 10 items are provided, defaults to auto-chunking into groups of 10. | auto |
| threads\_topic\_tag | String | No | A topic tag for the post (1-50 characters). Cannot contain periods (.) or ampersands (&). One tag per post. Helps increase reach. | - |

More than 10 items: Threads supports a maximum of 10 media items per post (carousel). If you provide more than 10 items, the API will automatically create multiple posts, distributing media across posts (up to 10 items each). Use threads\_thread\_media\_layout to control exactly how media items are distributed across posts.

The global description field is ignored for Threads photo uploads.

Upload Status

Check the status of asynchronous uploads initiated with async\_upload=true or scheduled posts.

Endpoint

Headers

| Name | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Authorization | Apikey your-api-key-here | Your API key for authentication |

Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| request\_id | String | Conditional | The request identifier returned by the upload endpoints when async\_upload=true. Use for async uploads. You can also provide your own request\_id when submitting the upload (via form field or X-Request-Id header) so you can poll status even if the upload response is lost due to a timeout. |
| job\_id | String | Conditional | The job identifier returned by scheduled posts. Use for posts with scheduled\_date. |

Note: At least one of request\_id or job\_id must be provided.

Behavior

Async uploads: When you submit an upload request with async\_upload=true, the API returns immediately with a request\_id. Use this to retrieve aggregated progress and results.

Scheduled posts: When you schedule a post with scheduled\_date, the API returns a job\_id. Use this to check the status after the scheduled time.

The top-level status field may be one of:

pending: The request has been accepted but no platform results have been recorded yet. For scheduled posts, this means the job has not executed yet.

queued: The upload is queued and waiting for a worker to begin processing.

processing: At least one platform is actively being processed while others are still queued or pending.

in\_progress: Some platform results have been recorded but not all.

completed: All platforms have finished successfully.

failed: All platforms have failed, or no activity has been recorded for over 1 hour.

not\_found: No upload request was found with the provided ID (returned with HTTP 404).

Individual platform results may have their own status:

queued: The platform upload is waiting to be processed.

processing: The platform upload is currently being processed.

completed: The platform upload finished successfully.

failed: The platform upload failed permanently.

retryable: The platform upload failed but is eligible for automatic retry.

Example Request

For async uploads:

For scheduled posts:

Example Response

For async uploads (request\_id) — in progress:

For scheduled posts (job\_id):

Failed upload:

Not found:

Responses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 200 OK | Success. Response includes request\_id or job\_id depending on which parameter was used. |
| 400 Bad Request | Missing both request\_id and job\_id: {"error":"request\_id or job\_id is required"} |
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid or expired token |
| 404 Not Found | No upload request found with the provided ID |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Server error with details |

SDK Examples

Python

JavaScript/Node.js

Polling Best Practices

The status endpoint uses internal caching. Polling faster than the cache refresh interval returns the same result and wastes your rate limit budget.

| Status | Cache TTL | Recommended poll interval |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| queued / pending | 2 seconds | Every 5–10 seconds |
| processing | 3 seconds | Every 10 seconds |
| completed / failed | 5 minutes | Stop polling — result is final |

For high-volume integrations, consider using webhooks instead of polling — you'll receive an instant POST notification when the upload completes.

See the full Rate Limits & Polling guide for detailed recommendations.

Note: Currently, this endpoint supports X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Facebook, Threads, Reddit, Bluesky, and Google Business Profile. More platforms will be added in future updates.

Endpoint

Headers

| Name          | Value                      | Description                              |
|---------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Authorization | Apikey your-api-key-here   | Your API key for authentication          |
| Idempotency-Key | unique-string | Optional. Prevents duplicate uploads if the same request is retried (e.g., after a timeout). Can also be sent as X-Idempotency-Key or X-Request-Id. When provided, if a matching upload job already exists, the API returns the existing job instead of creating a duplicate. |

Common Parameters

| Name          | Type   | Required | Description                                                                |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| user          | String | Yes      | User identifier                                                            |
| platform\[]    | Array  | Yes      | Platform(s) to upload to. Supported values: linkedin, x, facebook, threads, reddit, bluesky, google\_business |
| title         | String | Yes      | Default text content for the post.                                         |
| description    | String | No       | Optional extended body used only on Reddit (becomes the post text). Ignored elsewhere. |
| request\_id | String | No | Client-provided request identifier. If omitted, the server generates one. Returned in every response and used to track the upload via Upload Status. Useful when async\_upload=true and the HTTP response might be lost (e.g., timeout). Can also be sent as an X-Request-Id header. |
| scheduled\_date | String (ISO-8601) | No | Optional date/time (ISO-8601) to schedule publishing, e.g., "2024-12-31T23:45:00Z". Must be in the future (≤ 365 days). Omit for immediate upload. |
| timezone | String (IANA) | No | Optional timezone identifier (e.g., "Europe/Madrid", "America/New\_York"). If provided, scheduled\_date is interpreted in this timezone. Defaults to UTC if omitted. See IANA Time Zone Database for valid values. |
| async\_upload  | Boolean | No      | If true, the request returns immediately with a request\_id and processes in the background. See Upload Status. |
| add\_to\_queue  | Boolean | No      | If true, automatically schedules the post to your next available queue slot. Cannot be used with scheduled\_date. See Queue System. |
| max\_posts\_per\_slot | Integer | No | Override the profile's max posts per slot setting for this request. Only used when add\_to\_queue=true. See Queue System. |
| first\_comment | String | No       | Automatically post a first comment after publishing. Supported on Facebook, Threads, Bluesky, Reddit, X, YouTube, and LinkedIn. On X (Twitter) and Threads, this creates a reply to the main post (threading). On YouTube, it posts as a top-level comment. Note: Instagram does not support text-only posts, so this parameter is not applicable for Instagram here. |
| first\_comment\_media\[] | File(s) | No | Image files to attach to the first comment as inline images. Currently supported on Reddit. Not available for scheduled or queued posts. |
| link\_url      | String | No       | URL to include as a link preview card. When provided, platforms that support link previews (LinkedIn, Bluesky, Facebook, Reddit) will display a rich preview card with the page's title, description, and thumbnail image. Platform-specific parameters (linkedin\_link\_url, bluesky\_link\_url, facebook\_link\_url, reddit\_link\_url) take priority over this generic parameter. |

Important: If you set async\_upload to false but the upload takes longer than 59 seconds, it will automatically switch to asynchronous processing to avoid timeouts. In that case, use the request\_id with the Upload Status endpoint to check the upload status and result.

Scheduling behavior: When you provide scheduled\_date, the API responds with 202 Accepted and includes a job\_id. That same job\_id will later appear in Upload History to correlate the scheduled job with the publish record. You can also use the job\_id with the Upload Status endpoint to check the execution status of the scheduled post.

This endpoint supports simultaneous text uploads to X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Facebook, Threads, Reddit, and Bluesky.

Platform-Specific First Comments

The first\_comment parameter serves as a fallback. To set a custom first comment for a particular platform, use the optional \[platform]\_first\_comment parameter. If provided, it will override the main first\_comment for that platform.

Example Optional Parameters:

facebook\_first\_comment: "Let me know your thoughts in the comments!"

x\_first\_comment: "Thread incoming! 🧵"

threads\_first\_comment: "First comment on Threads!"

reddit\_first\_comment: "Source in the comments."

bluesky\_first\_comment: "More details in the replies."

linkedin\_first\_comment: "Source article in the comments."

Platform-Specific Titles

The title parameter serves as a fallback. To set a custom title for a particular platform, use the optional \[platform]\_title parameter. If provided, it will override the main title for that platform.

Example Optional Parameters:

linkedin\_title: "A professional insight on the latest industry trends."

x\_title: "New update out now! 📢"

facebook\_title: "Excited to share this with my Facebook friends."

threads\_title: "Just posted something new on Threads!"

|-------------------------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| linkedin\_title          | String | No       | Specific text for the LinkedIn post. Fallbacks to title.                                                 | title     |
| target\_linkedin\_page\_id | String | No       | LinkedIn page ID to upload text to an organization's page. If not provided, posts to the user's personal profile. |             |
| linkedin\_link\_url       | String | No       | URL to include as a link preview card on the LinkedIn post. LinkedIn will display a rich preview with the page's title, description, and thumbnail. Overrides the generic link\_url parameter for LinkedIn. | link\_url  |

X (Twitter)

:::warning URLs are stripped from every X post
Every URL that X would turn into a clickable link is removed from the caption,
title, and first\_comment before the tweet is created — schemed URLs
(https://, http://, ftp://), www. hosts, shorteners (t.co, bit.ly,
…), bare hostnames with a path (example.com/foo), and IPs with a path.

Obfuscated forms (example\[.]com, hxxp://, unicode dots) are not
stripped because X does not parse them as links — they display as plain text
and are billed at the normal $0.015 rate.

Why: X charges $0.200 per "Content: Create (with URL)" vs $0.015 for
posts without a URL. Stripping happens on every X path (video, photo, text,
scheduled, retried) so usage stays on the cheap tier. See the
Character Limits page
for the full policy.

How Twitter Threads Are Created

If your text in the title field is longer than 280 characters, our API automatically creates a Twitter thread. You don't need to do anything special. By default, x\_long\_text\_as\_post is false.

How it works:

Our system creates natural-looking threads by intelligently splitting your text:

It groups paragraphs: The system combines as many paragraphs (text separated by a blank line) as possible into a single tweet without exceeding the character limit.

It splits long paragraphs: If a single paragraph is too long for one tweet, it's split into smaller parts. The system first tries to split by line breaks and then by words.

This process ensures your threads are easy to read.

Example of a thread creation

If you send this text in the title:

The API will create a thread like this:

Tweet 1:

This is the first paragraph. It is short.

This second paragraph is a bit longer. Our API tries to keep paragraphs together in one tweet.

Tweet 2:

This is a much longer third paragraph. It probably won't fit with the others. It might even be too long for a single tweet. If so, the API will split it. It will first look for line breaks.

Tweet 3:

If a single line is still too long, it will split it by words. This creates a readable and well-structured Twitter thread automatically.

Facebook

| Name             | Type   | Required | Description                                                       | Default |
|------------------|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| facebook\_title   | String | No       | Specific text for the Facebook post. Fallbacks to title.        | title |
| facebook\_page\_id | String | Yes      | Facebook Page ID where the text will be posted.                   | -       |
| facebook\_link\_url | String | No       | Optional URL to include for link preview in text posts. If provided, it's sent as link to the Graph API and Facebook may render a preview card. | -       |

Note: If facebook\_page\_id is not provided, we will automatically use the user's only connected Page (if exactly one exists). If multiple Pages are connected, the API returns a helpful error with an available\_pages list so you can choose one. Posting to personal Facebook profiles via API is not supported by Meta; only Pages can be posted to.

Threads

| Name                        | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                              | Default |
|-----------------------------|---------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| threads\_title             | String  | No       | Specific text for the Threads post. Fallbacks to title.                                                                                | title |
| threads\_long\_text\_as\_post | Boolean | No       | If true, long text is published as a single post. If false (default), a thread is created if the text exceeds 500 characters.        | false |
| threads\_topic\_tag         | String  | No       | A topic tag for the post (1-50 characters). Cannot contain periods (.) or ampersands (&). One tag per post. Helps increase reach.        | -       |

Note: To upload content to Threads, specify the platform as "threads" in the platform\[] array.

How Threads Are Created

If the text you provide exceeds 500 characters and threads\_long\_text\_as\_post is false, our API will automatically create a thread on Threads, similar to how it works with X (Twitter).

How it works:

Our system creates natural-looking threads by intelligently splitting your text:

It groups paragraphs: The system combines as many paragraphs as possible into a single post without exceeding the character limit.

It splits long paragraphs: If a single paragraph is too long for a post, it is split into smaller parts, first trying to break by line breaks, and if that's not enough, by words.

This process ensures that your Threads are coherent and easy to read, replicating the functionality you already enjoy for X.

If you provide the global description field, it becomes the Markdown body of the Reddit post; otherwise we post only the title.

Link posts: When reddit\_link\_url (or the generic link\_url) is provided, the post is created as a Reddit link post (kind: link) with a URL preview card. The description field is ignored for link posts since Reddit link posts don't have a text body.

Note: To upload content to Reddit, specify the platform as "reddit" in the platform\[] array.

Bluesky

|---|---|---|---|---|
| bluesky\_title | String | No | Specific text for the Bluesky post. Fallbacks to title. | title |
| bluesky\_link\_url | String | No | URL to include as a link preview card on the Bluesky post. Bluesky will display a rich external embed with the page's title, description, and thumbnail. Overrides the generic link\_url parameter for Bluesky. | link\_url |
| reply\_to\_id | String | No | URL or AT-URI of the post to reply to. Creates a reply to the specified post. | - |

Note: To upload content to Bluesky, specify the platform as "bluesky" in the platform\[] array. The maximum character limit is 300 characters per post.

How Bluesky Threads Are Created

If your text exceeds 300 characters, our API automatically creates a Bluesky thread. This works similarly to X (Twitter) and Threads.

How it works:

Our system creates natural-looking threads by intelligently splitting your text:

It groups paragraphs: The system combines as many paragraphs (text separated by a blank line) as possible into a single post without exceeding 300 characters.

It splits long paragraphs: If a single paragraph is too long for one post, it's split into smaller parts. The system first tries to split by line breaks and then by words.

Example of a thread creation

If you send this text in the title:

The API will create a thread like this:

Post 1:

This is the first paragraph. It is short.

This second paragraph is a bit longer. Our API tries to keep paragraphs together.

Post 2:

This is a much longer third paragraph. It probably won't fit with the others. If so, the API will split it into multiple posts automatically.

Upload Video

Upload video to various social media platforms using this endpoint.

Endpoint

Headers

| Name | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Authorization | Apikey your-api-key-here | Your API key for authentication |
| Idempotency-Key | unique-string | Optional. Prevents duplicate uploads if the same request is retried (e.g., after a timeout). Can also be sent as X-Idempotency-Key or X-Request-Id. When provided, if a matching upload job already exists, the API returns the existing job instead of creating a duplicate. |

Common Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| user | String | Yes | User identifier |
| platform\[] | Array | Yes | Platform(s) to upload to (e.g., "tiktok", "instagram", "linkedin", "youtube", "facebook", "twitter", "threads", "pinterest", "bluesky", "reddit", "google\_business") |
| video | File | Yes | The video file to upload (can be a file upload or a video URL) |
| title | String | Conditional | Default title of the video. Required for YouTube and Reddit. Optional for all other platforms (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, Threads, Bluesky, Pinterest). |
| description | String | No | Optional extended text used only on LinkedIn commentary, Facebook descriptions, YouTube descriptions, and Pinterest notes. Ignored elsewhere. |
| scheduled\_date | String (ISO-8601) | No | Optional date/time (ISO-8601) to schedule publishing, e.g., "2024-12-31T23:45:00Z". Must be in the future (≤ 365 days). Omit for immediate upload. |
| timezone | String (IANA) | No | Optional timezone identifier (e.g., "Europe/Madrid", "America/New\_York"). If provided, scheduled\_date is interpreted in this timezone. Defaults to UTC if omitted. See IANA Time Zone Database for valid values. |
| request\_id | String | No | Client-provided request identifier. If omitted, the server generates one. Returned in every response and used to track the upload via Upload Status. Useful when async\_upload=true and the HTTP response might be lost (e.g., timeout). Can also be sent as an X-Request-Id header. |
| async\_upload | Boolean | No | If true, the request returns immediately with a request\_id and processes in the background. See Upload Status. |
| add\_to\_queue | Boolean | No | If true, automatically schedules the post to your next available queue slot. Cannot be used with scheduled\_date. See Queue System. |
| max\_posts\_per\_slot | Integer | No | Override the profile's max posts per slot setting for this request. Only used when add\_to\_queue=true. See Queue System. |
| first\_comment | String | No | Automatically post a first comment after publishing. Supported on Instagram, Facebook, Threads, Bluesky, Reddit, X, YouTube, and LinkedIn. On X (Twitter) and Threads, this creates a reply to the main post. For X threads, the comment is posted as a reply to the last tweet in the thread. On YouTube, it posts as a top-level comment on the video. |
| first\_comment\_media\[] | File(s) | No | Image files to attach to the first comment as inline images. Currently supported on Reddit. Not available for scheduled or queued posts. |

Important: If you set async\_upload to false but the upload takes longer than 59 seconds, it will automatically switch to asynchronous processing to avoid timeouts. In that case, use the request\_id with the Upload Status endpoint to check the upload status and result.

Scheduling behavior: When you provide scheduled\_date, the API responds with 202 Accepted and includes a job\_id. That same job\_id will later appear in Upload History so you can correlate the scheduled job with the eventual publish record. You can also use the job\_id with the Upload Status endpoint to check the execution status of the scheduled post.

Platform-Specific First Comments

The first\_comment parameter serves as a fallback. To set a custom first comment for a particular platform, use the optional \[platform]\_first\_comment parameter. If provided, it will override the main first\_comment for that platform.

Example Optional Parameters:

instagram\_first\_comment: "Follow for more content! #photography"

facebook\_first\_comment: "Let me know your thoughts in the comments!"

x\_first\_comment: "Thread incoming! 🧵"

youtube\_first\_comment: "Subscribe for more videos!"

reddit\_first\_comment: "Source in the comments."

bluesky\_first\_comment: "More details in the replies."

linkedin\_first\_comment: "Source article in the comments."

Platform-Specific Titles

The title parameter serves as a fallback. To set a custom title for a particular platform, use the optional \[platform]\_title parameter. If provided, it will override the main title for that platform.

| disable\_comment | Boolean | No | Disable comments | false |
| disable\_stitch | Boolean | No | Disable stitch feature | false |
| post\_mode | String | No | DIRECT\_POST: Directly post the content to TikTok user's account or MEDIA\_UPLOAD: Upload content to TikTok for users to complete the post using TikTok's editing flow. Users will receive an inbox notification. | DIRECT\_POST |
| cover\_timestamp | Integer | No | Timestamp in milliseconds for video cover | 1000 |

Note on Draft Mode (MEDIA\_UPLOAD): When using MEDIA\_UPLOAD mode (Draft), TikTok does not allow setting a title, caption, privacy settings, or other metadata via the API. The video is simply uploaded to your TikTok inbox/drafts, and you must add the title, caption, and settings manually within the TikTok app before publishing.

The global description field is ignored for TikTok uploads.

Instagram

For more information about Instagram API parameters, visit the Instagram Graph API documentation.

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| instagram\_title | String | No | Specific title for the Instagram post. Fallbacks to title. | title |
| media\_type | String | No | Type of media ("REELS" or "STORIES") | "REELS" |

| collaborators | String | No | Comma-separated list of collaborator usernames (not available for Trial Reels) | - |
| cover\_url | String | No | URL for custom video cover. You can also send a binary image via the cover\_image field (see below). | - |
| cover\_image | File | No | Binary cover image file (JPEG, ≤ 8MB). Uploaded to a public URL automatically. If both cover\_image and cover\_url are provided, cover\_url takes precedence. | - |
| audio\_name | String | No | Name of the audio track embedded in your video | - |
| user\_tags | String | No | Users to tag on the Reel. Accepts a comma-separated list (e.g., "@user1, user2") — Instagram does not require coordinates for video tags. | - |
| location\_id | String | No | Instagram location ID | - |
| thumb\_offset | String | No | Timestamp offset for video thumbnail, expressed in milliseconds | - |

Tagging on photo posts is different. For /upload\_photos, Instagram requires x/y coordinates in a JSON array and silently drops username-only tags. See Upload Photo → Instagram user\_tags.

Trial Reels (share\_mode)

Trial Reels allow you to test content with non-followers first to see how it performs before sharing with your followers. This feature is available for public Instagram accounts with at least 1,000 followers.

Available share\_mode values:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| CUSTOM | Regular Reel (default) - Shown to all followers immediately |
| TRIAL\_REELS\_SHARE\_TO\_FOLLOWERS\_IF\_LIKED | Trial Reel with auto-share - Shown to non-followers first. If it performs well within 72 hours, Instagram automatically shares it with your followers |
| TRIAL\_REELS\_DONT\_SHARE\_TO\_FOLLOWERS | Trial Reel without auto-share - Shown only to non-followers. You decide later in the Instagram app if you want to share with followers |

Important notes about Trial Reels:

Only you can see that a Reel is marked as a Trial. To everyone else, it appears as a regular Reel.

Your followers won't see the Trial on your profile or in their feeds unless you (or Instagram, if auto-share is enabled) choose to share it.

Collaborators cannot be added to Trial Reels.

There may be limits on how many Trial Reels you can publish within a certain period.

Note on Instagram audio\_name

Scope: Reels only, and only for the original audio embedded in your uploaded video. It does not let you pick licensed/trending music from Instagram’s library via API.

Limit: You can rename only once (when creating the Reel via API, or later from the audio page if you are the audio owner).

Behavior: The Reel is published using the audio embedded in your video and displays the name you provide in audio\_name.

The global description field is ignored for Instagram video uploads.

Subtitles: You can upload multiple subtitle files by using indexed fields (youtube\_subtitle\_file\_0, youtube\_subtitle\_language\_0, youtube\_subtitle\_file\_1, youtube\_subtitle\_language\_1, etc.). Each subtitle file requires a corresponding language code. Subtitles are uploaded after the video is processed using the YouTube Captions API.

Region restrictions: allowedCountries and blockedCountries cannot be used simultaneously. Country codes must be ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (e.g., "US", "CA", "MX").

Language settings: defaultLanguage affects title and description display, while defaultAudioLanguage specifies the spoken language in the video. Use BCP-47 codes (e.g., "es" for Spanish, "es-ES" for Spain Spanish).

Legal declarations: selfDeclaredMadeForKids is used for COPPA compliance. containsSyntheticMedia provides transparency for AI-generated content. hasPaidProductPlacement ensures FTC compliance.

X (Twitter)

:::warning URLs are stripped from every X post
Upload-Post removes every URL that X would turn into a clickable link from
the caption, title, and first\_comment before sending the tweet — schemed
URLs (https://, http://, ftp://), www. hosts, shorteners (t.co,
bit.ly, …), bare hostnames with a path (example.com/foo), and IPs with a
path.

Obfuscated forms (example\[.]com, hxxp://, unicode dots) are not
stripped because X does not parse them as links — they display as plain text
and are billed at the normal $0.015 rate.

Why: X bills $0.200 per post that contains a URL vs $0.015 without —
13× more. Stripping happens on every X path (video, photo, text, scheduled
and retried). See the
Character Limits page
for details.

How X (Twitter) Thread Creation Works (Advanced Logic)

Note: The following describes the default thread creation logic. To override this and post long text as a single post, set the x\_long\_text\_as\_post parameter to true.

The system is engineered to create well-formatted, natural-looking threads on X (formerly Twitter). Instead of simply splitting text at every line break, it intelligently groups paragraphs to create more readable tweets.

Here's the step-by-step logic:

Intelligent Paragraph Grouping (Primary Method):

The function first identifies distinct paragraphs (any text separated by a blank line).
It then combines as many of these paragraphs as possible into a single tweet, filling it up to the 280-character limit without exceeding it. The double newline (\n\n) between combined paragraphs is preserved for formatting.
This results in fewer, more substantial tweets that flow naturally, just as if a person had written them.

Handling Exceptionally Long Paragraphs:

If a single paragraph is, by itself, longer than the 280-character limit, a more granular splitting logic is automatically triggered for that paragraph only:

Split by Line Break: The system first attempts to break the paragraph down by its individual line breaks (\n).

Split by Word: If any of those single lines are still too long, it will split them by words as a final resort.

Media Attachment:

For posts that include photos or videos, all media is attached only to the first tweet of the thread. The subsequent tweets in the thread will be text-only replies.

| redirect\_button\_text | String | No | (Optional) The text to display on the redirect button after linking. Defaults to "Logout connection". |
| connect\_title | String | No | (Optional) Custom title text for the connection page. Defaults to "Connect Social Media Accounts". |
| connect\_description | String | No | (Optional) Custom description text for the connection page. Defaults to "Connect your social media accounts to manage your posts.". |
| platforms    | Array   | No       | (Optional) List of platforms to show for connection. Possible values: 'tiktok', 'instagram', 'linkedin', 'youtube' (not working, waiting for audit), 'facebook', 'x', 'threads', 'google\_business'. Defaults to all supported platforms. |
| show\_calendar | Boolean | No       | (Optional) Whether to show the calendar view on the connection page. Defaults to true.         |
| readonly\_calendar | Boolean | No   | (Optional) When true, shows only a read-only calendar view. The user cannot edit, delete, or create posts, and cannot connect or disconnect social accounts. Ideal for sharing a content calendar with end clients. Defaults to false. |

Example Body:

Success Response (200 OK):

access\_url: The secure URL your user needs to visit. Redirect your user to this URL.

success: Always true if the request was successful.

duration: The validity period of the generated JWT (48 hours).

Example Request (curl):

Example Request with Calendar Disabled (curl):

Example Request with Read-Only Calendar for Clients (curl):

This generates a link where the client only sees the calendar with scheduled posts (social channel, date/time, visual, text) but cannot edit anything or access other sections.

Example Success Response (200 OK):

Calendar Deep Link: If you want users to land directly on the shared calendar view, replace the path with /connect/calendar while keeping the token intact, e.g. https://app.upload-post.com/connect/calendar?token=GENERATED\_JWT\_TOKEN. The page will automatically fall back to /connect when the profile has show\_calendar disabled. When readonly\_calendar is true, the user is automatically redirected to the calendar view regardless of the URL path.

Error Responses:

400 Bad Request: Missing or invalid username.

401 Unauthorized: Invalid or missing API Key.

403 Forbidden: Profile exists but is blocked by plan limits (error\_code: PROFILE\_BLOCKED).

404 Not Found: No profile found with the provided username (error\_code: PROFILE\_NOT\_FOUND).

Integration tip: If JWT generation returns 404, call GET /api/uploadposts/users first to confirm the profile exists and that profile creation did not fail due to plan limits.

Mobile OAuth Compatibility

When users open the connection page on a mobile device (iOS or Android), the
operating system may intercept OAuth URLs (e.g. instagram.com, accounts.google.com)
and open the corresponding native app instead of keeping the flow in the browser.
Because native apps cannot handle the OAuth authorization URL, the connection fails.

Upload-Post automatically detects mobile browsers and routes OAuth redirects through
a secure intermediate page (/api/uploadposts/oauth/bounce) that performs the
redirect via JavaScript. This bypasses Universal Links (iOS) and App Links (Android)
interception so the OAuth flow stays entirely in the mobile browser.

No action is required from API consumers — the mobile-safe redirect is applied
automatically when the user accesses the access\_url on a mobile device.

Endpoint: Validate JWT

(Optional) Allows you to validate a JWT token. The primary validation occurs automatically when the user accesses the access\_url.

Method: POST

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_JWT\_TOKEN

Body Parameters: None

Example Request (curl):

Success Response (200 OK - Valid Token): Returns the profile details associated with the token.

profile: Contains details about the user profile linked to the token.

social\_accounts: An object showing the connection status for various platforms (e.g., null if not connected, or details if connected).

username: The unique identifier provided when the profile was created.

success: Indicates the token is valid.

Success Response (200 OK - Invalid Token):

Error Responses:

401 Unauthorized: Invalid, expired, or missing JWT token in the Authorization header.

Facebook Pages

Retrieve Facebook page IDs associated with user profiles to enable posting to Facebook pages.

Endpoint

Get Facebook Pages

Fetches Facebook page IDs associated with a profile. You can use this endpoint to connect and start posting on Facebook pages.

Video Format Requirements

This document outlines the video format requirements for uploading to various social media platforms via the API.

Automatic Video Transformation

Our API automatically transforms videos to adapt them to the specifications of each social network. However, if you use this feature, the upload will take longer because the transformation is performed first before uploading to the platforms.

If you prefer faster uploads, you can pre-process your videos according to the specific requirements of each platform outlined in this document.

Video Encoding Compatibility

Some video creation tools occasionally produce videos with encoding that Meta's systems don't accept. At times, their output needs to be re-encoded for compatibility.

One Solution: Re-encode with FFmpeg

If your video uploads are failing, try re-encoding the video using FFmpeg, an open-source tool for video processing:

This command converts your video to use the widely-compatible H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec, which Meta platforms accept.

Re-encoding "normalizes" your video to use standard encoding parameters that Meta's platforms are designed to process, without sacrificing quality. If you see these errors regularly, this simple step can save you frustration when sharing your creative content.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| event | string | The type of event: upload\_completed. |
| job\_id | string | The persistent job identifier returned when the post was created or scheduled. Use this to correlate webhook events with your original API requests. Only present when the upload was triggered via the API with a job\_id. |
| user\_email | string | The email address of the user who initiated the upload. |
| profile\_username | string | The username of the profile associated with the upload. |
| platform | string | The social platform where the post was uploaded (e.g., instagram, youtube, tiktok). |
| media\_type | string | The type of media uploaded (video, photo, or text). |
| title | string | The title provided for the post. |
| caption | string | The caption or description of the post. |
| result | object | An object containing the outcome of the upload attempt. |
| result.success | boolean | true if the upload was successful, false otherwise. |
| result.url | string | The direct URL to the published post (if available and successful). |
| result.publish\_id | string | The ID assigned to the post by the platform. |
| result.error | string | A description of the error if the upload failed. |
| created\_at | string | The timestamp of the event in ISO 8601 format. |

social\_account\_connected

Sent when a social account is successfully connected or reconnected via OAuth.

social\_account\_disconnected

Sent when a social account is disconnected. This can happen due to:

Manual disconnection by the user

Automatic disconnection due to persistent authentication failures (account blocked)

social\_account\_reauth\_required

Sent when a social account's access token can no longer be refreshed and the user must re-authenticate. This typically happens when:

The refresh token has expired

The user revoked access on the platform

Multiple consecutive token refresh attempts have failed

Connection Status Event Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| event | string | The event type: social\_account\_connected, social\_account\_disconnected, or social\_account\_reauth\_required. |
| user\_email | string | The email address of the account owner. |
| platform | string | The social platform (e.g., instagram, youtube, tiktok, x, linkedin, facebook, threads, pinterest, reddit, bluesky, snapchat, google\_business, tiktok\_business). |
| account\_name | string | The account identifier on the platform (e.g., username, channel ID). |
| status | string | The new connection status: connected, disconnected, or reauth\_required. |
| profile\_username | string | The Upload-Post profile associated with this account (if applicable). |
| reason | string | Additional context for the status change (e.g., manual\_disconnect, account\_blocked, token\_refresh\_threshold\_exceeded, max\_auth\_strikes). Only present for disconnected and reauth\_required events. |
| created\_at | string | The timestamp of the event in ISO 8601 format. |

Usage Notes

Idempotency: While we strive to deliver each notification exactly once, you should handle potential duplicate events based on your own unique identifiers if necessary (though post\_id or publish\_id can serve this purpose for successful posts).

Security: Ensure your webhook endpoint is secure (HTTPS) and verify the data as needed for your application logic.

Event Filtering: Use the webhook\_events field in your notification settings to subscribe only to the events you need. If not specified, all events are enabled by default.

Replacing Polling: If you were previously polling the profile endpoint to check connection status, subscribe to social\_account\_connected, social\_account\_disconnected, and social\_account\_reauth\_required events instead.

AI Shorts Uploader

The AI Shorts Uploader is a built-in assistant in the Upload-Post dashboard that watches your short-form video and writes the title, description and hashtags for each platform you publish to — YouTube, Instagram and TikTok — in seconds.

It is available from the Shorts Uploader screen in the app via the Generate with AI button.

What it does

When you click Generate with AI, the platform:

Sends your video to a multimodal AI model (Gemini).

Analyses the visual content, pacing and on-screen text.

Returns optimized copy per platform:

YouTube — title (≤100 chars) + description (≤5,000 chars) with relevant hashtags.

Instagram — caption (≤2,200 chars) tuned for Reels.

TikTok — caption (≤150 chars) tuned for the For You feed.

You can also rewrite an already-generated set of captions into another language (Spanish, English, Japanese, …) without re-uploading the video. Each rewrite counts as one analysis.

Monthly quotas per plan

Each successful analysis (and each language rewrite) consumes one unit from your monthly quota. The counter resets every 30 days from your last reset.

| Plan          | Analyses per month |
| :------------ | -----------------: |
| Free          |                 10 |
| Basic         |                100 |
| Professional  |                300 |
| Advanced      |                600 |
| Business      |              1,000 |

When you reach your quota, the dashboard shows an in-app message and the API responds with HTTP 429. Quotas reset automatically at the start of your next billing cycle.

Video requirements

| Constraint   | Limit         |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Max file size | 100 MB       |
| Max duration | 5 minutes     |
| Format       | .mp4 recommended |

These limits exist because the feature is tuned for short-form vertical content. For longer videos, generate captions manually or use the FFmpeg Video Editor API to trim a highlight first.

Error responses

When the monthly quota is exhausted:

HTTP status: 429 Too Many Requests.

If you also see a separate yellow banner reading "Too many requests. Please wait a moment before trying again", that is the global per-minute API rate limit (see Rate limits) — wait a few seconds and retry.

FAQ

Does retrying a failed analysis count twice? No. The counter is incremented only after a successful analysis is returned to your browser.

Can I see how many analyses I have left? The dashboard shows the remaining count in the response of every analysis. A standalone usage endpoint is on the roadmap.

Is the feature available on the public API? Today it is dashboard-only. API access for analyze-shorts is on the roadmap; reach out to support if you need early access.

Airtable Integration

Manage your video uploads to social media platforms directly from Airtable.

Set Up

Running Airtable Automation Scripts requires a paid Airtable plan that includes automations with scripts.

This guide shows you how to automatically upload videos to social media platforms from Airtable via Upload-Post.

Gather Your API Key

Start by getting your API Key from your Upload-Post account in the "API Keys" section. This key will be used in the script.

Be sure you have configured your social media accounts in Upload-Post before proceeding.

:::info
URL Support for Media Files: You can now pass URLs for both photo and video uploads instead of binary files. Simply provide the direct URL to your media file in the video or photos\[] parameter.
:::

Create an Airtable Workspace

In Airtable, create a new workspace with these fields:

Title as Single Line Text

Platforms as Multi Select with types: tiktok, instagram

Video as Attachment

User as Single Line Text

Status as Single Line Text

Enter Test Video Data

Add sample data to test the integration:

Title: Enter a title for your video

Platforms: Select one or more platforms (tiktok, instagram)

Video: Attach a video file (MP4 format recommended)

User: Enter your username

Status: Enter pending (lowercase)

Build an Automation Script

Let's create an Airtable automation script that uploads videos via Upload-Post:

Add Trigger

In your workspace, click on Automation then +New automation

Name the automation

Click Choose a Trigger

Select When a Record is Created

Select your table

Click Done

Add Action

Click Add Action

Select Run Script

Delete any default code in the script editor

Copy and paste this code:

Replace Your API Key with your actual Upload-Post API key.

Test the Script

In the script editor, press >Test

The script will run and process any pending records. If successful, you'll see your videos being uploaded to the selected platforms, and the Status field will update to "success".

Security Best Practices

Never share your API key

Consider using environment variables where possible

Review records before processing large batches

Avoid Timeouts with Asynchronous Uploads

Are your requests taking too long and resulting in timeouts? For video, photo, or text post uploads that may require more processing time (file processing, social network publishing queues, etc.), use the async\_upload parameter to make your request asynchronously.

How does it work?

Send your request with async\_upload=true to the appropriate upload endpoint.

The API will immediately respond with a request\_id.

Use this request\_id to check the progress and result at the status endpoint.

Checking Status

The status endpoint supports two different identifier types:

request\_id: Returned by upload endpoints when async\_upload=true

job\_id: Returned when you schedule posts with scheduled\_date

For Async Uploads

For Scheduled Posts

After scheduling a post with scheduled\_date, the API returns a job\_id. Use it to check the status after the scheduled time:

Relevant Endpoints

Text upload: POST /api/upload\_text

Video upload: POST /api/upload

Photo upload: POST /api/upload\_photos

Upload status: GET /api/uploadposts/status?request\_id=\<REQUEST\_ID> or ?job\_id=\<JOB\_ID>

Quick Example: Asynchronous Video Upload

API Error Handling: Upload Endpoints

This document explains the structure of responses you will receive from the Video Upload (POST /api/upload) and Photo Upload (POST /api/upload\_photos) endpoints, including how success and errors are indicated.

1\. Successful Request Processing (HTTP 200 OK)

When your upload request is successfully processed by our server (meaning your authentication was valid, input was generally okay, and usage limits weren't exceeded before starting), you will always receive an HTTP 200 OK status code.

The JSON response body will look like this:

Key Points:

"success": true indicates the API server processed your request.

"results": This dictionary is crucial. It contains the outcome for each individual platform you requested.

Platform Success: If results\[platform].success is true, the upload to that platform likely succeeded. Additional platform-specific IDs (like publish\_id, container\_id, post\_id) may be included.

Platform Failure: If results\[platform].success is false, the upload to that specific platform failed. The results\[platform].error field will contain a message explaining the reason (e.g., token expired, API error from the platform, file issue).

Important: An error on one platform (like LinkedIn in the example) does not stop attempts on other platforms. Always check the success flag for each platform in the results.

"usage": Provides information about your current API usage count and limit after this request.

2\. Request Failure (Non-200 HTTP Status Codes)

If there's a fundamental problem with your request before we attempt to upload to individual platforms, you will receive an HTTP status code other than 200 OK. The response body will typically look like this:

Here are common error status codes and their meanings:

400 Bad Request

Meaning: Your request was malformed or missing required information.

Common Causes: Missing video or photos file, missing title, invalid platform name, missing user identifier in the form data when required.

message examples: "Video file and title are required", "Title cannot be empty", "Username required", "Invalid platforms: \[platform\_name]", "Username not associated with any profile".

401 Unauthorized

Meaning: Authentication failed.

Common Causes: Missing Authorization header, using an invalid or expired API Key or Bearer Token.

message examples: "Authorization header required", "Invalid or expired token", "Invalid API key", "API key expired".

404 Not Found

Meaning: The user associated with your authentication could not be found in our system.

message example: "User not found".

429 Too Many Requests

Meaning: You have exceeded an API usage limit.

Common Causes: Reaching your monthly upload limit, or (for Professional plan users) reaching the daily upload limit for a specific social media account.

message examples: "You have reached your monthly limit of X uploads", "You have reached the daily limit of 5 uploads for: Instagram (account\_name)".

500 Internal Server Error

Meaning: An unexpected error occurred on our server while processing your request.

message example: Usually contains technical details about the error. If you encounter this repeatedly, please contact support.

In summary: Always check the HTTP status code first. If it's 200 OK, examine the success flag within the results dictionary for each platform. If it's not 200 OK, check the message field in the response body for the reason.

Limit of uploads

Social Hard Caps Per Network

To protect your connected accounts and stay compliant with each social network, Upload-Post enforces platform hard caps using a rolling 24-hour window. When a cap is reached for a specific account on a given network, further posts to that account/network are rejected until the window rolls over.

What counts toward the cap: only successful publishes recorded for that account/network in the last 24 hours.

Scope: Per connected social account. These limits are NOT global to your Upload-Post user.

Example: If you manage 5 Profiles, and each Profile has its own TikTok account connected, you get the full limit for each TikTok account. (e.g., 5 TikTok accounts × 15 posts = 75 posts per day total).

Scheduled posts: caps are re-checked at execution time; if the cap is already reached, the publish will be rejected then.

Recommended and enforced daily caps

| Social Network     | Hard Cap (posts per 24h) |
| :----------------- | -----------------------: |
| Instagram          |                       50 |
| TikTok             |                       15 |
| LinkedIn           |                      150 |
| YouTube            |                       10 |
| Facebook           |                       25 |
| X (Twitter)        |              See per-plan table below |
| Threads            |                       50 |
| Pinterest          |                       20 |
| Reddit             |                       40 |
| Bluesky            |                       50 |

X (Twitter) per-plan daily caps

X uploads have a per-plan hard cap (one cap per connected X profile, per 24-hour rolling window) instead of a single flat limit. All other platforms keep the flat caps shown above.

| Plan         | X Hard Cap (posts per profile per 24h) |
| :----------- | -------------------------------------: |
| Default (free) |                                   10 |
| Basic        |                                     10 |
| Professional |                                     20 |
| Advanced     |                                     30 |
| Business     |                                     30 |

Error response when the cap is reached

Status: 429 Too Many Requests

Body example:

What else the verifier checks

Duplicate/similar content within 48h (per account/network) to reduce spam risk and shadow bans.

Mention limits to avoid spammy behavior (e.g., excessive mentions or repeating the same handle too frequently).

Media and content sanity checks evolve over time to align with network guidelines.

Make Integration

Upload-Post provides seamless integration with Make (formerly Integromat) for automated video publishing workflows. This guide walks you through connecting your Upload-Post account with Make in 3 simple steps.

Getting Started with Upload-Post

Create an account or log in to your existing Upload-Post account

Navigate to the "API Keys" section

Generate an API key for your Make integration

API Configuration

For Make integration, you'll need to configure an HTTP module with the following parameters:

Note: Find your API key in your Upload-Post Manage API Keys section.

:::info
URL Support for Media Files: You can now pass URLs for both photo and video uploads instead of binary files. Simply provide the direct URL to your media file in the video or photos\[] parameter.
:::

Form Data Configuration & Make.com Setup

Configure your Make HTTP module with these parameters:

| Field | Value | Required |
| ----- | ----- | -------- |
| title | Your video title | Optional |
| user | Your username | Required |
| platform\[] | tiktok | Required |
| video | Binary file | Required |

Make.com Configuration Steps:

Add an HTTP Module: In your Make.com scenario, add an HTTP module and choose the "Make a Request" action.

Configure the Request Settings:

Method: Set to POST.

URL: Enter https://api.upload-post.com/api/upload.

Headers: Add a header with:

Key: Authorization

Value: Apikey \[YOUR\_API\_KEY]

Set the Request Body: Change the body type to multipart/form-data and add the following form fields:

title: Set the value to your desired title (you can use a variable if needed).

user: Enter your username you set in Upload-Post.

platform\[]: Set the value to tiktok.

video: Attach the binary file (your video file). Make sure this field is mapped to the binary data you want to send.

Save and Test: Save your scenario and run a test to ensure that the video upload works correctly via the API.

Advanced Configuration Options

For Instagram Uploads

To upload to Instagram instead, simply change the platform value to instagram in your form data.

Uploading to Multiple Platforms

To upload to both TikTok and Instagram simultaneously, add both platform values by creating multiple fields with the same name platform\[] in the Make.com HTTP module.

Securely Storing API Keys in Make.com

For better security, avoid hardcoding your API key directly in scenarios:

Create an App Key in Make.com

Store your Upload-Post API key as a constant

Reference the constant in your HTTP module headers

When sharing scenarios, use scenario blueprints which do not expose your keys

Example of referencing an API key constant in Make:

MCP Server (Claude / Cursor)

Upload-Post ships an official Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Connect it to Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or any other MCP-compatible AI agent and your assistant can publish, schedule, analyze and manage social media on your behalf — without writing any code.

The server exposes 40 tools that map 1:1 to the public Upload-Post REST API.

Hosted endpoint: https://mcp.upload-post.com/mcp

Source: github.com/Upload-Post/upload-post-mcp (MIT)

How authentication works

The server is multi-tenant and stateless. Each MCP client sends its own Upload-Post API key in the Authorization header of every request. The server uses that key for the duration of the session and stores nothing.

Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_UPLOAD\_POST\_API\_KEY is also accepted, for clients that only allow Bearer tokens.

Get your API key

Sign in to app.upload-post.com.

Open the API Keys section.

Generate a new key and copy it.

Connect Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor

Add the following entry to your MCP config (~/.claude/mcp.json, ~/.cursor/mcp.json, or your IDE's equivalent):

Restart your client. You should see 40 upload-post tools become available.

What the agent can do

| Group         | Tools |
|---------------|-------|
| Upload        | upload\_video, upload\_photos, upload\_text, upload\_document |
| Status        | get\_status, get\_job\_status, get\_history, get\_media |
| Schedule      | list\_scheduled, cancel\_scheduled, edit\_scheduled |
| Analytics     | get\_analytics, get\_total\_impressions, get\_post\_analytics, get\_platform\_metrics |
| Users         | get\_account\_info, list\_users, create\_user, delete\_user, generate\_jwt, validate\_jwt |
| Pages / boards| get\_facebook\_pages, get\_linkedin\_pages, get\_pinterest\_boards, get\_google\_business\_locations, select\_google\_business\_location, get\_reddit\_detailed\_posts |
| Comments      | get\_post\_comments, reply\_to\_comment, public\_reply\_to\_comment |
| DMs           | send\_dm, list\_dm\_conversations, manage\_autodms |
| FFmpeg        | submit\_ffmpeg\_job, get\_ffmpeg\_job, download\_ffmpeg\_result, get\_ffmpeg\_consumption |
| Queue         | get\_queue\_settings, update\_queue\_settings, preview\_queue |

Async uploads return a request\_id; the agent polls get\_status until success: true.

Example prompts

Once connected, try these in your AI client:

"List the users in my Upload-Post account."

"Publish this video URL to TikTok and Instagram under the profile marketing with the caption 'Spring launch'."

"Schedule a text post on LinkedIn for next Monday at 10:00 Madrid time."

"Show me the analytics for my profile marketing over the last month."

"Reply privately to the latest comment on my Instagram post."

The model decides which tools to call based on the request; you don't have to name them.

Self-hosting (optional)

If you prefer to run the server yourself — for an isolated network, custom auth proxy, or stricter compliance requirements — the source repository ships with a multi-stage Dockerfile and a one-click Coolify configuration. See the project README for instructions.

Local-only stdio mode

For single-user setups (no hosted server), you can run the MCP locally via npx. Once published to npm, the configuration becomes:

Both modes expose the same 40 tools.

Rate Limits & Polling Best Practices

Upload-Post applies rate limits at multiple levels to protect the service and the social media platforms. This guide explains each limit and how to design your integration to work within them.

API Rate Limits

Every authenticated API response includes rate limit headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| X-RateLimit-Limit | Maximum requests allowed in the current window |
| X-RateLimit-Remaining | Requests remaining in the current window |
| X-RateLimit-Reset | Unix timestamp when the window resets |

When you exceed the limit, the API returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests. Wait until the X-RateLimit-Reset timestamp before retrying.

Upload Status Polling

When using async\_upload=true, you need to poll the Upload Status endpoint to get the result. Here are the recommended intervals:

Polling Strategy

Recommended Polling Intervals

| Scenario | Poll Interval | Max Wait |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Photo uploads | Every 5–10 seconds | 2 minutes |
| Video uploads (small, < 50 MB) | Every 10 seconds | 5 minutes |
| Video uploads (large, > 50 MB) | Every 15 seconds | 10 minutes |
| Scheduled posts (after scheduled time) | Every 30 seconds | 10 minutes |
| Queued posts | Every 60 seconds | Until next queue slot |

Status Cache TTLs

The status endpoint uses internal caching. Here is how often the status value is refreshed:

| Status | Cache TTL | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| queued | 2 seconds | The upload is waiting for a worker |
| pending | 2 seconds | Accepted but not yet started |
| processing | 3 seconds | At least one platform is actively uploading |
| completed | 5 minutes | All platforms finished successfully |
| failed | 5 minutes | All platforms failed |

Key takeaway: Polling faster than every 5 seconds for non-terminal states is unnecessary — the cache refreshes every 2–3 seconds. For terminal states (completed/failed), the result is cached for 5 minutes, so subsequent polls are fast.

Alternative: Use Webhooks

Instead of polling, configure a webhook to receive a POST notification when the upload completes. This is more efficient for high-volume integrations:

The webhook fires once per platform per upload, so you get immediate notification without polling.

Upload Rate Limits

Per-Request Duplicate Protection

The API prevents duplicate uploads using idempotency keys and rate limiting:

Same content to same platform: If you submit an identical upload (same user, platform, and content hash) within a short window, the API returns the existing request instead of creating a duplicate.

Idempotency-Key header: Send a unique Idempotency-Key or X-Idempotency-Key header to ensure exactly-once processing, even across retries.

Daily Upload Caps (per platform per account)

Each social account has a daily hard cap based on platform limits. Exceeding these returns HTTP 429:

| Platform | Max posts / 24h |
|----------|----------------|
| Instagram | 50 |
| TikTok | 15 |
| LinkedIn | 150 |
| YouTube | 10 |
| Facebook | 25 |
| X (Twitter) | 50 |
| Threads | 50 |
| Pinterest | 20 |
| Reddit | 40 |
| Bluesky | 50 |

These are rolling 24-hour windows per social account, not per API key.

Monthly API Usage

Your plan determines how many API upload calls you can make per month:

| Plan | Monthly uploads |
|------|----------------|
| Free | 10 |
| Paid plans | See pricing |

Check your current usage with GET /api/uploadposts/me — the response includes api\_usage.count.

API Key Brute-Force Protection

Failed authentication attempts (invalid API keys) are rate-limited per IP:

After 10 consecutive failed attempts with the same invalid key, the IP is blocked for 5 minutes.

The API returns HTTP 429 during the block period.

Best Practices

Use webhooks instead of polling when possible — they're instant and don't consume rate limit budget.

Respect X-RateLimit-Remaining — stop sending requests when it reaches 0.

Use exponential backoff on 429 responses — don't hammer the API after hitting a limit.

Set async\_upload=true for all uploads — synchronous uploads timeout after 59 seconds anyway.

Send Idempotency-Key for all upload requests — this protects you from duplicate posts if your HTTP client retries on timeout.

Poll at the recommended intervals — faster polling just returns cached results and wastes your rate limit budget.

Error: {"code":"reached\_active\_user\_cap"}

If you've encountered this error, don't worry. This is not an issue with your account, your content, or our platform's stability. It's a temporary limitation from the TikTok API.

This error means that the daily limit of active users allowed by TikTok for our application has been reached.

What is a "Daily Active User"?

In this context, a "daily active user" is anyone who uses our application to interact with the TikTok API on a given day. TikTok sets a cap on how many unique users can do this through a single application (like ours) within a 24-hour period.

What should you do?

Your account and content are safe. This is not a penalty or a block on your account.

The best solution is to wait and retry. The user cap is reset by TikTok every 24 hours. We recommend waiting a few hours before trying to post again.

If the error persists for more than 24 hours, please try again the next day.

Why does this happen?

To manage their platform's resources, TikTok imposes a daily usage quota on every application that connects to its API. Due to the rapid growth of our user community, we are sometimes hitting this maximum allowed number of daily users.

What are we doing about it?

We are actively working on a solution. We are in direct communication with TikTok's developer support team to request an increase in our daily user quota.

Unfortunately, the timeline for this increase is determined by TikTok, and we cannot expedite their internal review process. We appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this for good.

Thank you for your understanding. We are committed to providing a reliable service and are doing everything we can to support our growing community.

White-label Integration Guide

Profiles diagram

This guide explains how to integrate Upload-Post directly into your own platform. This allows your users to connect their social media accounts securely through Upload-Post, enabling your platform to manage their profiles and posts via the API on their behalf.

Integration Flow Overview

The core idea is to create a unique profile within Upload-Post for each user on your platform who wants to connect their social accounts. You then generate a special, secure URL that the user visits to link their accounts. Once linked, your platform can interact with the Upload-Post API using the user's unique identifier.

Step-by-Step Integration

Step 1: Create a User Profile

For each user on your platform, you need to create a corresponding profile in Upload-Post. This is done by making a POST request to the /api/uploadposts/users endpoint.

Requirement: You must provide a unique username in the request body. This username should be a stable identifier that links the Upload-Post profile back to the user on your platform (e.g., your internal user ID).

Authentication: Remember to include your Authorization: Apikey YOUR\_API\_KEY header.

Result: The API will respond with details of the created profile, confirming the username.

➡️ See details: Create User Profile API Reference

Step 2: Generate the Secure JWT URL

Once the profile exists, you need to generate a secure URL that your user will use to connect their social media accounts. Make a POST request to the /api/uploadposts/users/generate-jwt endpoint.

Requirement: In the request body, provide the same unique username (from Step 1). You can also include the following optional fields:

redirect\_url: A URL to which the user will be redirected after linking their account.

logo\_image: A URL to a logo image for branding on the linking page.

redirect\_button\_text: (Optional) The text to display on the redirect button after linking. Defaults to "Logout connection".

connect\_title: (Optional) Custom title text for the connection page.

connect\_description: (Optional) Custom description text for the connection page.

platforms: (Optional) List of platforms to show for connection. Defaults to all supported platforms.

show\_calendar: (Optional) Whether to show the calendar view on the connection page. Defaults to true.

readonly\_calendar: (Optional) When true, shows only a read-only calendar view. Users cannot edit, delete, or create posts, and cannot connect or disconnect social accounts. Ideal for sharing a content calendar with end clients. Defaults to false.

Authentication: Include your Authorization: Apikey YOUR\_API\_KEY header.

Result: The API will return a JSON object containing an access\_url. This URL contains a secure token (JWT) valid for 48 hours.

➡️ See details: Generate JWT URL API Reference

Quick troubleshooting (common integration mistakes):

If generate-jwt returns 404, call GET /api/uploadposts/users and verify the profile username exists.

If profile creation returns 403, you hit your plan profile limit. Resolve limits before retrying JWT generation.

Always treat profile creation and JWT generation as two explicit checked steps (do not ignore non-2xx responses).

Step 3: User Connects Accounts

Redirect your user to the access\_url obtained in Step 2. This URL will open the Upload-Post connection interface, guiding the user through the process of securely connecting their desired social media accounts (like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, etc.) to their profile.

Enhanced Connect Experience:

Professional Navigation: Tab-based interface for easy switching between account connection and calendar view

Calendar View (if enabled): Users can view their scheduled posts and upload history directly from the connect page

Customizable Interface: You can control the branding, title, and available features through the JWT parameters

Secure OAuth Flows: Upload-Post handles all authentication and token storage securely

The connection URL is valid for 48 hours, giving users ample time to complete the linking process.

Step 4: Manage User Content via API

After the user successfully connects their accounts in Step 3, your platform can now use other Upload-Post API endpoints to manage content on their behalf.

When making calls to endpoints like Upload Photo or Upload Video, you will typically include the user's unique username (the one you used in Step 1 and 2) in the request parameters to specify which profile's connected accounts should be used.

You can also retrieve the list of profiles and their connected accounts using the GET /api/uploadposts/users endpoint.

➡️ See details: Get User Profiles API Reference

Read-Only Calendar for Clients

If you're an agency managing content for clients, you can generate a read-only calendar link that lets your clients view their scheduled posts without being able to edit anything.

Use the readonly\_calendar parameter when generating the JWT:

The returned access\_url will show:

Social media channel for each post

Scheduled date and time

Visual (photo/video preview)

Post text/caption

The client cannot:

Edit, delete, or reschedule posts

Connect or disconnect social accounts

Access any other section of Upload-Post

This is ideal for agencies that need to share content calendars with end clients for approval or visibility.

Authentication

All API requests related to user profile management (/api/uploadposts/users and /api/uploadposts/users/generate-jwt) require authentication using your API Key. Include it in the Authorization header for every request:

Replace YOUR\_API\_KEY with the actual API key provided to you.

(Note: The /api/uploadposts/users/validate-jwt endpoint uses Bearer token authentication, as detailed in its specific documentation).

Next Steps

With the user profiles created and accounts linked, explore the other API references to start managing content:

Understanding YouTube API Quota Limits

⚠️ DEPRECATED:
We have now received our own dedicated YouTube API quota. You no longer need to configure your own Google Cloud project. All YouTube features are available directly from our platform without any extra setup.

We believe in being transparent with our community about the challenges we face and the solutions we implement. This document explains the current situation regarding YouTube's API quota and introduces a new feature that gives you more control.

The Challenge: YouTube's API Quota

Every application that interacts with YouTube, including ours, is subject to a daily API quota. This quota determines how many actions (like uploads, comments, or data requests) can be performed through our platform each day.

Due to the incredible growth of our user base, we are frequently reaching the limit of our current quota. This can sometimes result in temporary service disruptions for YouTube-related features.

What We Are Doing About It

For the past six months, we have been in ongoing discussions with YouTube's leadership team to request a significant increase in our daily quota. We believe a higher quota is essential to reliably serve our growing community.

Unfortunately, this process has been slower than anticipated, and we are still awaiting a final decision. We are persistently following up and providing all necessary information to make our case.

Our Solution: Use Your Own Google Cloud Project

To provide a stable and reliable solution while we wait for the quota increase, we have implemented a new feature: you can now connect your own Google Cloud project to our application.

By doing this, you will use your own personal YouTube API quota instead of our shared, limited quota.

Benefits of This Approach:

Reliability: You are no longer affected by our shared quota reaching its limit. As long as your personal quota has not been exceeded, your YouTube actions will succeed.

Control: You have full visibility and control over your own API usage through your Google Cloud Console.

No More Waiting: This immediately solves the issue for you, without having to wait for our negotiations with YouTube to conclude.

How to Connect Your Own Google Cloud Project

Here is a step-by-step guide to connect your own project and use your personal API quota:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Create a new project or select an existing one.

Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project. You can find this in the "APIs & Services" > "Library" section.

Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".

Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".

If prompted, configure the "OAuth consent screen":

Select "External" for the user type.

Provide an app name (e.g., "My Upload-Post Connection"), your user support email, and developer contact information. You can use your own email address for all fields.

For the "Application type", choose "Web application".

Under "Authorized redirect URIs", click "ADD URI" and paste the following URL:

Click "Create". You will now see your Client ID and Client Secret.

Copy these credentials. You will need to enter them into our application to complete the connection.

After obtaining your Client ID and Client Secret, you can securely enter them in your account settings within our application to finalize the connection.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. We remain committed to resolving the quota issue at the platform level and will keep you updated on our progress.

Social Media Character Limits

This guide summarizes the most relevant text limits for each social network supported by Upload-Post. Keep these constraints in mind when building payloads so posts are accepted without truncation.

:::warning URLs are automatically removed from X posts
Upload-Post strips every URL that X would turn into a clickable link from any
caption, title, description, or first\_comment sent to X (Twitter), before
the post is published. This applies to video, photo, and text uploads via
every endpoint and via the scheduler.

Why: X charges $0.200 per "Content: Create (with URL)" request versus
$0.015 for posts without a URL — a 13× surcharge. To keep pricing predictable,
every parseable link is removed before the tweet leaves Upload-Post.

What gets stripped: anything X's parser recognises as a URL:

Schemed URLs: https://…, http://…, ftp://…, ws://…

www.host.tld\[/path]

Common shorteners: t.co/…, bit.ly/…, tinyurl.com/…, lnkd.in/…,
youtu.be/…, etc.

Bare hostnames with a path: example.com/posts/1

IPv4 with a path: 192.168.1.1:8080/admin

Markdown link syntax: \[text]\(https://…) (the URL portion is removed)

What is NOT stripped: anything that X does not parse as a link does not
trigger the surcharge, so we leave it alone — e.g. example\[.]com,
example(dot)com, hxxp://…, unicode-dot lookalikes (example．com), or
bare domains with no path. These display as plain text in the tweet and are
billed at the normal $0.015 rate.

If you need to share a link, put it in your X profile bio or render it visibly
inside an image/video.

Bluesky Character Limits

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| post | 300 characters maximum |
| images | Up to 4 images per post |
| altText | Supported |

YouTube Character Limits

| Property | Description |

|-------|-------|
| Post summary (title) | 1,500 characters |
| Event title | 58 characters |
| Offer coupon code | 58 characters |
| Offer terms | 1,000 characters |
| CTA URL | Standard URL length |

Notes:

Google Business Profile supports one photo per post via the API.

Video uploads are not supported via the API.

Product posts cannot be created via the API.

Upload-Post validates content against a list of prohibited hashtags before posting to Instagram. Posts containing any of these hashtags will be rejected with a validation error. The complete list of banned hashtags includes:

A: anorexia, alone, a$$, antivax, abdl, addmysc, adulting, always, armparty, asiagirl

B: beautyblogger, bikinibody, boho, blogladrona, brain, besties, bikinibod

C: costumes, curvygirls, cancer

D: date, dating, desk, dm

E: elevator, edm, endme

F: followtrain, followtrains

G: graffitiigers, girlsonly, gloves

H: hardworkpaysoff, happythanksgiving, humpday, hustler, hotgirls

I: iphonegraphy, italiano, ifb

K: kansas, killingit, kissing, kill, killme, killyourself, kys

M: master, models, mustfollow, milf, midget

N: nasty, newyearsday

P: petite, petitegirls, pushups, payme

S: saltwater, shit, shower, single, singlelife, skype, snap, snapchat, snapchatme, snowstorm, sopretty, stranger, streetphoto, sunbathing, swole, suicide, suicideawareness

T: tag4like, tanlines, teens, teen, thought, todayimwearing

U: undies, unbalanced

V: valentinesday

W: workflow

Y: youngmodel, yolo

If your content includes any of these hashtags, remove them before submitting your request to avoid validation errors.

API Considerations

Upload-Post validates payload sizes before sending them to social networks whenever limits are known. Requests that exceed the documented limits return a validation error.

Some platforms might truncate overlong text instead of rejecting it (Meta products and YouTube occasionally do this). Inspect the per-platform response inside results to confirm the final content.

For channels with strict limits such as X, consider shortening URLs in your application prior to calling the Upload-Post API.

Updates and Changes

Social networks regularly adjust their limits. We keep this page aligned with the latest behavior we observe in production, but you should also:

Check Upload-Post API responses for detailed error messages about rejected posts.

Subscribe to our release notes for platform updates.

Revisit this reference periodically, especially before large content campaigns.

Common Errors

This guide covers the most common errors you might encounter when using Upload-Post and how to resolve them. Errors are organized by category to help you quickly find solutions.

Session Expired {#session-expired}

Session and authentication errors occur when the connection between Upload-Post and your social media account has been broken. This is usually easy to fix by reconnecting your account.

Common Session Errors

| Error Message | Platform | Solution |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| "Your \[Platform] session has expired" | All | Reconnect your account |
| "Token expired and refresh failed" | All | Reconnect your account |
| "The session has been invalidated because the user changed their password" | Facebook/Instagram | Reconnect after password change |
| "Error validating access token" | Facebook/Instagram | Verify permissions and reconnect |
| "Your X session has expired and could not be refreshed" | X (Twitter) | Reconnect your X account |
| "User has not authorized application" | Various | Grant permissions and reconnect |
| "Unauthorized" | Various | Reconnect your account |

How to Fix Session Errors

Grant all permissions - Make sure to approve all requested permissions during reconnection

:::tip
If you recently changed your password on a social media platform, you'll need to reconnect that account in Upload-Post.
:::

Account Blocked {#account-blocked}

These errors occur when there's an issue with your account on the social media platform itself. Upload-Post cannot fix these - you need to resolve them directly on the platform.

Common Account Status Errors

| Error Message | Platform | What It Means |
|---------------|----------|---------------|
| "Sessions for the user are not allowed because the user is not a confirmed user" | Facebook | Account needs verification |
| "The YouTube account of the authenticated user is suspended" | YouTube | Account suspended by YouTube |
| "Your account is temporarily locked" | X (Twitter) | X has locked your account |
| "The Instagram account is restricted or inactive" | Instagram | Instagram has restricted your account |
| "Action suspected as spam. Activity is restricted" | Instagram | Spam detection triggered |
| "The user used for authentication is suspended" | Various | Account suspended on platform |

How to Fix Account Blocked Errors

These issues must be resolved directly on the social media platform:

Facebook/Instagram Account Not Confirmed

Go to facebook.com and log in

Check for any verification prompts or security notices

Go to Settings & Privacy > Settings > Personal Details

Verify your email and phone number are confirmed

Visit Facebook Account Quality to check for restrictions

After resolving issues, reconnect in Upload-Post

X (Twitter) Account Locked

Go to twitter.com or x.com and log in

Follow the prompts to unlock your account (may require phone verification)

Fixing Media URL Issues

If you're getting "Media could not be fetched" errors:

Check the URL is publicly accessible - Open it in an incognito browser window

Don't use private/restricted URLs - Google Drive links must be set to "Anyone with the link"

Use direct file URLs - The URL should end with a file extension like .jpg or .mp4

Check file size - Very small files (< 1KB) often indicate a broken link

Rate Limits {#rate-limits}

These errors occur when you've hit posting limits or the platform is experiencing temporary issues.

Common Rate Limit Errors

Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ covers the most common questions about Upload-Post. Questions are organized by category to help you find answers quickly.

Connection & Authentication

Where do I find my API Key?

Log in to your Upload-Post Dashboard

Navigate to the "API Keys" section

Click "Generate New API Key"

Copy and securely store your API key

Include your API key in the Authorization header of all API requests:

How do I connect my TikTok/Instagram/Facebook/YouTube/LinkedIn account?

Go to Manage Users in your dashboard

Click "Connect" next to the platform you want to add

Follow the OAuth authorization flow for that platform

Grant all requested permissions when prompted

Once connected, the account will appear in your profile

Why do I get error 400 when connecting Instagram?

Error 400 when connecting Instagram usually means:

Account not confirmed: Your Facebook/Instagram account needs email or phone verification. Go to Facebook Account Quality to check for issues.

Missing permissions: During connection, make sure to approve ALL requested permissions.

Business account required: Instagram API requires a Business or Creator account linked to a Facebook Page.

Page not connected: Instagram must be linked to a Facebook Page. Create one at facebook.com/pages/create if needed.

How do I get my Facebook Page ID?

Use our API endpoint to retrieve all Facebook Pages associated with your account:

The response includes page\_id, page\_name, and the associated profile for each page.

:::info
Facebook API does not support posting to personal profiles—only Pages can be posted to. If you don't have a Page, create one at facebook.com/pages/create.
:::

How does JWT work for white-label integrations?

JWT (JSON Web Token) enables white-label integrations where your users connect their social accounts through your platform:

Create a profile for your user via POST /api/uploadposts/users

Generate a secure URL via POST /api/uploadposts/users/generate-jwt

Redirect your user to the returned access\_url

The user connects their accounts through Upload-Post's interface

Use the API with the user's username to post on their behalf

The JWT URL is valid for 48 hours. See the White-label Integration Guide for full details.

How long do tokens last before I need to reconnect?

Token validity varies by platform:

| Platform | Typical Duration | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| TikTok | ~60 days | Auto-refreshes if used regularly |
| Instagram | ~60 days | May expire after password changes |
| Facebook | ~60 days | May expire after password changes |
| LinkedIn | ~60 days | Auto-refreshes if used regularly |
| YouTube | ~6 months | May require re-authorization |
| X (Twitter) | Long-lived | Usually stable unless revoked |

When a token expires, you'll receive a "session expired" error. Simply reconnect the account at Manage Users.

Limits & Quotas

How many posts can I make per day on each platform?

Upload-Post enforces platform hard caps using a rolling 24-hour window to protect your accounts:

| Platform | Daily Limit (per account) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Instagram | 50 posts |
| TikTok | 15 posts |
| LinkedIn | 150 posts |
| YouTube | 10 videos |
| Facebook | 25 posts |
| X (Twitter) | 50 posts |
| Threads | 50 posts |
| Pinterest | 20 pins |
| Reddit | 40 posts |
| Bluesky | 50 posts |

What does error 429 (Too Many Requests) mean?

Error 429 indicates you've hit a rate limit. This can happen when:

Monthly upload limit reached: Your plan's monthly quota is exhausted

Daily platform cap reached: You've hit the 24-hour limit for a specific platform/account

Example response:

Solution: Wait for the 24-hour window to roll over, or spread posts across multiple connected accounts.

Are limits per account or per profile?

Limits are per connected social account, not per Upload-Post user or profile.

Example: If you manage 5 Profiles, and each has its own TikTok account connected, you get the full limit for each TikTok account (5 TikTok accounts × 15 posts = 75 TikTok posts per day total).

What does "unlimited uploads" mean in the Basic plan?

"Unlimited uploads" refers to the number of API calls you can make per month through Upload-Post. However, you're still subject to:

Platform daily caps (enforced per social account to protect against bans)

Profile limits (based on your plan tier)

Platform-specific restrictions (each social network's own rules)

How many profiles can I connect on each plan?

Check upload-post.com/pricing for the current limits per plan. You can see your current limit and usage via the GET /api/uploadposts/users endpoint, which returns a limit field showing your maximum allowed profiles.

Video Uploads

How do I upload YouTube Shorts vs regular videos?

YouTube automatically determines if a video is a Short based on:

Duration: 60 seconds or less

Aspect ratio: Vertical (9:16) or square (1:1)

Simply upload your video normally to the /api/upload endpoint. YouTube will classify it as a Short if it meets these criteria.

:::warning
Custom thumbnails are not supported for YouTube Shorts—they only apply to standard YouTube videos.
:::

What is the maximum video file size?

Maximum file sizes vary by platform:

| Platform | Max File Size | Max Duration |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| TikTok | 4 GB | 10 minutes |
| Instagram | 300 MB | 15 minutes |
| YouTube | 256 GB | 12 hours |
| LinkedIn | 5 GB | 10 minutes |
| Facebook | ~1 GB | 240 minutes |
| X (Twitter) | 1 GB+ (Premium) | 4 hours (Premium) |
| Threads | 1 GB | 5 minutes |
| Pinterest | 1 GB | 15 minutes |
| Reddit | 1 GB | 15 minutes |
| Bluesky | 100 MB | 3 minutes |

See Video Requirements for detailed format specifications.

Can I use a video URL instead of uploading the file?

Yes! Instead of uploading a file, you can pass a direct URL to your video:

Requirements for video URLs:

URL must be publicly accessible (test in an incognito browser)

Should be a direct link to the file (ending in .mp4, .mov, etc.)

Google Drive links must be set to "Anyone with the link"

File must not be too small (< 1KB often indicates a broken link)

Why is my video stuck in "processing"?

Videos may remain in processing status for several reasons:

Long upload: If sync upload takes > 59 seconds, it automatically switches to async processing

Platform processing: The social network is processing your video (especially for large files)

Encoding issues: The video format may need transcoding

To check status, use the Upload Status endpoint:

Status values: pending → in\_progress → completed

How do I upload videos to TikTok drafts (MEDIA\_UPLOAD mode)?

Use the post\_mode parameter set to MEDIA\_UPLOAD:

:::info
In MEDIA\_UPLOAD (Draft) mode, TikTok does not allow setting title, caption, privacy, or other metadata via API. The video uploads to your TikTok inbox/drafts, and you must add all details manually in the TikTok app before publishing.
:::

Photo & Carousel Uploads

How do I upload carousels to Instagram/TikTok/Facebook?

Upload multiple photos using the /api/upload\_photos endpoint with the photos\[] array:

Mixed carousels (photos + videos) are supported on Instagram and Threads only:

How many photos can I include in a carousel?

| Platform | Max Photos per Post |
|----------|---------------------|
| Instagram | 10 items (photos/videos mixed) |
| Threads | 10 items (photos/videos mixed) |
| TikTok | Multiple (photo slideshow) |
| Facebook | Multiple |
| Pinterest | 5 carousel images |
| Bluesky | 4 images |
| X (Twitter) | 4 images |
| Reddit | 1 image per post |

For X (Twitter), use x\_thread\_image\_layout to control how images are distributed across tweets when posting more than 4 images. For Threads, use threads\_thread\_media\_layout to control how media items are distributed across posts when posting more than 10 items.

What image resolution/size should I use?

Recommended specifications by platform:

| Platform | Recommended Size | Max File Size | Formats |
|----------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| Instagram | 1080x1350 (4:5) | 8 MB | JPG, PNG |

Use the auto\_add\_music parameter:

TikTok will automatically add background music to your photo slideshow.

Scheduling

How do I schedule a post for later?

Add the scheduled\_date parameter (ISO-8601 format) to any upload request:

The API returns a job\_id that you can use to check status, edit, or cancel the scheduled post.

Constraints:

Must be in the future

Maximum 365 days ahead

What timezone does the API use?

By default, the API uses UTC. To use a different timezone, add the timezone parameter:

Use any valid IANA timezone identifier (e.g., Europe/Madrid, America/Los\_Angeles, Asia/Tokyo).

How do I check the status of a scheduled post?

Use the Upload Status endpoint with the job\_id:

To list all scheduled posts:

To cancel a scheduled post:

See Manage Scheduled Posts for full details.

n8n Integration

How do I configure credentials in n8n?

Add an HTTP Request Node to your workflow

Set Method to POST

Set URL to https://api.upload-post.com/api/upload

Under Headers, add:

Name: Authorization

Value: Apikey YOUR\_API\_KEY

Set Body to multipart/form-data

Add required parameters: user, title, platform\[]

Security tip: Use n8n's Credentials store instead of hardcoding your API key.

How do I pass binary files in n8n?

In the HTTP Request node, use the formBinaryData option:

This passes the binary data from a previous node (like a Google Drive trigger) as the video file.

Alternative: You can pass a video URL instead of binary data:

Where do I find the Upload-Post n8n community node?

Currently, Upload-Post integration is done via the standard HTTP Request node. We provide:

Complete JSON node configuration

Example workflow template on n8n.io

See our n8n Integration Guide for step-by-step setup instructions.

Common Errors

Error: "Username required in form data"

The user parameter is missing from your request. This field identifies which Upload-Post profile to use.

Error: "Video URL is not accessible"

The provided video URL cannot be fetched. Check that:

The URL is publicly accessible (test in incognito browser)

The URL points directly to a video file (not a webpage)

For Google Drive: sharing is set to "Anyone with the link"

The file exists and isn't too small (< 1KB indicates broken link)

Error: "TikTok photo upload timed out"

TikTok photo uploads can be slow. Try:

Use async\_upload=true to avoid timeout

Reduce image file sizes

Upload fewer photos at once

Check TikTok service status

Error: "File name too long"

Some platforms reject files with very long names. Rename your file to something shorter (under 100 characters) before uploading.

Error 502/504 Gateway Timeout

These indicate server-side timeouts, usually for large files or slow platform responses.

Solutions:

Use async\_upload=true for large uploads

Reduce file size if possible

Retry the request

If persistent, contact support

Error: "Your \[Platform] session has expired"

Your social account connection has expired. Go to Manage Users, disconnect the account, and reconnect it.
